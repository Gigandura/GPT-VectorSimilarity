PASSAGE: great potential for construction activity detection. The construction of smart cities and the machine learning tech- nology make important contributions to the researches and applications of sound monitoring systems. With the rapid development of informa- tion and communication technology (ICT) in recent years for smart city construction, various physical devices are installed and connected to the network (the Internet of things or IoT) to optimize the eciency of city operations and services. Among them, acoustic sensors are also placed to monitor urban environmental noise [12,13], which brings convenience for signal collection of construction sound monitoring. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103125 Received 27 June 2019; Received in revised form 17 January 2020; Accepted 6 February 2020  Corresponding author at: Tongji University, College of Civil Engineering and State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering, Siping 1239, Shanghai 200092, China.

T Meanwhile, the accurate classication of sounds is made possible for the explosive development of machine learning. The symbolic learning algorithm that mainly includes ID3, C4.5, CART and random forest [14] is an important branch of classication algorithm for the ease of un- derstanding. With the advantages of accurate recognition, strong gen- eralization and fast classication, the random forest algorithm is con- sidered as one of the best classication algorithms [15]. Although great progresses have been made in the eld of sound monitoring systems, there are still some problems in the current re- searches. It is arduous for monitoring systems to identify dierent types of construction activities, as the construction activities have many si- milarities in acoustic signals. The monitoring systems also face the challenges in reducing false alarms under dierent environmental noise. It is necessary to establish a sound monitoring system that can identify multiple construction activities under common environmental noise. Considering the advantages of sound monitoring systems and the problems in the current researches, this paper proposes a random forest-based sound monitoring system for prevention of underground pipeline damage caused by construction, which can accurately identify three types of construction activities under common urban environ- mental noise. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the arrangement and implement of eld testing, where the acoustic signals of construction activities and environmental noise are acquired and analyzed in time and frequency domain. The methodology of feature extraction and random forest-based classier training is proposed in the Section 3 and Section 4. Section 5 elaborates the monitoring strategy and testies the proposed monitoring system. In the end, the conclu- sions are drawn in Section 6. 2. Field tests for collection of sound signal samples 2.1. Field tests Field tests are rst conducted to collect sound signals under dif- ferent circumstances. The working sounds of electric hammers, road cutters and excavator breaking hammers are selected as the typical construction threats. The three types of environmental noise induced by pedestrian, trac and wind are considered as the background noise of construction activities. In addition, the construction sounds without any environmental noise and the three types of environmental noise are also recorded for comparison. All these sound signals are collected by a recording device ICD-SX1000 and the sampling rate is set to 96 kHz. A 2.17-hour database so far composed of various records is created for further research with the details given in Table 1. (See Fig. 1.) 2.2.

RESPONSE:

According to the passage, the proposed sound monitoring system is designed to accurately identify three types of construction activities (electric hammers, road cutters, and excavator breaking hammers) under common urban environmental noise. The system uses the random forest algorithm, which is considered to be one of the best classification algorithms available.
