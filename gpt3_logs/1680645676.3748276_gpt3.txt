QUESTION: What is the color of brad Henry


PASSAGE: environmental noise is compared with that of environmental noise, and all the time series data are presented in Fig. 2. The acoustic signals of winds and road cutters have the largest amplitudes with the maximum values approaching 1. The amplitudes of the electric hammer records are mainly below 0.5, and those of the excavator breaking hammer records are roughly between 0 and 0.4. It is obvious that the amplitudes of pedestrian noise and trac noise concentrating around 00.2 are smaller than other records. Using the information in the time series data, the acoustic signals of construction can be distinguished from the pedestrian noise and the trac noise. However, due to the similarity in amplitude, it seems dicult to separate wind noise and the sounds of road cutters in time series. The environmental noise and the acoustic signals of equipment in frequency domain are shown in Fig. 3. For the excavator breaking hammer, there are several peaks in the frequency spectrum when the frequency is lower than 2900 Hz, and the amplitude decreases at fre- quencies greater than 2900 Hz. The electric hammer has a maximum amplitude near 750 Hz, and after that the amplitude decreases as the frequency increases. The road cutter records have multiple peaks be- tween 0 and 15,000 Hz. The peak frequencies of pedestrian noise and trac noise are below 200 Hz, while those of wind noise are within 0- 500 Hz. In general, the dierences between the construction sounds and the environmental noise at high frequencies may provide a strong basis for identifying construction threats. 3. Acoustic feature extraction As the acoustic signals are short-term stationary, it is necessary to separate each signal into frames before extracting features. The specic method is to slide a xed-size window on the time series and to select the fragment within the window as a frame. In this paper, the size of the window is 20 ms (1920 values), and the sliding distance of the window is set to 10 ms (960 values). Hamming window function is applied to reduce the high-frequency signals caused by signal segmentation. All the frames can be given by: =    +   y n Ham n x i s n n l ( ) ( ) [( 1) ], 1 i (1) where yi(n) is the n-th value of the i-th frame in time domain, Ham(n) is the Hamming window function x, is the acoustic signal to be divided, s is the distance of each sliding and l is the size of window. According to the signal analysis in Section 2, three features con- sisting of short-term energy, short-term zero-crossing rate and Mel- frequency cepstral coecients (MFCC) [1618] are employed for sound recognition, as described below in details. 3.1. Short-term energy Short-term energy is the acoustic feature in time domain, commonly used in speech recognition to determine the starting point of speech. In this work, short-term energy is used to determine the starting and ending points of construction threat sounds. It is dened as:  =     E y n ( ) t 2 (2) where Et is the short-term energy of a frame. The construction sounds without background noise and the three types of environmental noise are used to evaluate the short-time energy feature, as plotted in Fig. 4(a). It can be found that this feature is good at distinguishing the construction threats from pedestrian or trac noise, but cannot eectively distinguish the threats from wind noise. 3.2. Short-term zero-crossing rate Short-term zero-crossing rate is also extracted as a feature, which is dened as times that the signal waveform crosses the horizontal axis, and can be calculated by: Table 1 Sound signal records.
