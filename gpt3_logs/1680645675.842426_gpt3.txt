QUESTION: What is the color of brad Henry


PASSAGE: variety of noise conditions and the probability of a false alarm. Two ratios are hence proposed for evaluating the testing results. The recognition rate (R) is dened by: = R T T / r a (10) where Tr is the number of the detected construction threat samples; Ta is the number of all construction threat samples. The false alarm rate (F) can be calculated by: = F T T / p b (11) where Tp is the number of the environmental noise samples causing false alarm;Tb is the number of all the environmental noise samples. It can be seen from Tables 4 and 5 that the average recognized rate and the average false alarm rate of the monitoring system are 95.59% and 1.12%. The standard deviations in Table 4 and Table 5 indicate that the performance of the system is stable for dierent threat events and environmental noise. All the results prove that the system can eec- tively detect the construction threats around pipelines. 6. Conclusion Construction activities have posed serious threats on underground pipeline in recent years. In the framework of multi-class classication as usually followed by a standard procedure of collecting datafeature extractionclassier trainingmonitoring scheme, this paper pre- sents a random forest-based sound monitoring system for prevention of underground pipeline damage caused by construction. The working sounds of construction equipment including excavator breaking hammers, road cutters and electric hammers are collected as the signals of typical construction threats. The three types of environ- mental noise induced by pedestrian, trac and wind are also taken into account as the background noise. The core of the system is the double-layer identication scheme that consists of two random forest-based classiers. The classier-1 rst takes the short-term energy and the short-term zero-crossing rate as features for determining the starting and ending points of the suspected sounds. Then the classier-2, which is trained by including MFCC as another feature, identies the suspicious segments for checking the results of classier-1 and obtaining the types of construction threats. In virtue of the double-layer design, the proposed system can achieve high recognition rate and low consumption. In the test, the detected threat signals account for 95.59% of all threat signals, while only 1.12% of the environmental noise causes false alarms. The standard deviations of the recognition rate and the false alarm rate indicate that the performance of the system is stable for the three pipeline threats and various environmental noise. Therefore, the monitoring system performs well under dierent types of environ- mental noise and can play an important role in preventing pipeline damage caused by construction.
