PASSAGE: a machine learning algorithm proposed by Breiman [14]. Random forest is an integrated learning model assembled by multiple decision trees [20]. Each decision tree separately classies the unknown samples, and then the result of the random forest model is obtained according to the voting result of the decision trees. The training ow of decision trees is as follows: (1) Randomly generate N sets TS1, TS2, , TSN (N is equal to the number of the trained decision trees) by the Bootstrap method [21] as the training sets of N decision trees. (2) In the training ow of each decision tree, m (an integer greater than 0 and less than the total number of features) features are rst se- lected from all the features as the splitting feature selection set of the current node, and then the node of the decision tree is split with the best-performing feature in the selection set. (3) Each decision tree grows completely without pruning. 5. Monitoring strategy and testing results 5.1. Monitoring strategy After training the two classiers for dierent purposes, a strategy for monitoring construction threats on underground pipeline can be set up, as shown in Fig. 6, which is mainly followed by the steps: (1) Sound signal collectioncollecting sound signals by microphones placed along pipelines. The distances between microphones mainly depend on the eective identication range of the classier and should be adjusted according to the importance of the pipeline, the frequency of threats and the environmental noise level. In general, the distance can be set to 60 m. Fig. 5. MFCC calculation process. Table 2 Numbers of training samples.

RESPONSE:

The machine learning algorithm proposed by Breiman, known as Random Forest, is an integrated learning model assembled by multiple decision trees. Each decision tree separately classifies the unknown samples, and then the result of the random forest model is obtained according to the voting result of the decision trees. The training flow of decision trees is as follows: (1) Randomly generate N sets TS1, TS2, ..., TSN (N is equal to the number of the trained decision trees) by the Bootstrap method as the training sets of N decision trees. (2) In the training flow of each decision tree, m (an integer greater than 0 and less than the total number of features) features are first selected from all the features as the splitting feature selection set of the current node, and then the node of the decision tree is split with the best-performing feature in the selection set. (3) Each decision tree grows completely without pruning. After training the two classifiers for different purposes, a strategy for monitoring construction threats on underground pipeline can be set up, as shown in Figure 6, which is mainly followed by the steps: (1) Sound signal collection—collecting sound signals by microphones placed along pipelines. The distances between microphones mainly depend on the effective identification range of the classifier and should be adjusted according to the importance of the pipeline, the frequency of threats and the environmental noise level. In general, the distance can be set to 60 m. (2) Signal segmentation—segmenting sound records to obtain samples. The acoustic signals collected by microphones are segmented and windowed for the samples that can be identified by the two classifiers. (3) Double-layer identification scheme—calculating the required features and identifying samples through the double-layer classifier composed of classifier-1 and classifier-2. In the framework, the short-term energy feature and the short-term zero-rate feature of the samples are first calculated to detect the starting and ending points of the construction threats using the classifier-1. After recognizing the suspected threat sounds by the classifier-1, the MFCC feature is calculated and combined with the short-term energy feature and the short-term zero-rate feature for the identification of the classifier-2. The classifier-2 serves to review the results of classifier-1 and to determine the type of construction threats. (4) Sending alarm—sending alarm to the management center based on the results from the double-layer classifier. If the duration of the construction threat sound exceeds the alert value, the alarm device will upload the report to prevent construction threats.
