QUESTION: What is the color of brad Henry


PASSAGE: n l 2 (3) where Z is the short-term zero-crossing rate of a frame and sgn[] is sign function with the expression given as: =     < sgn x y n y n [ ] 1, ( ) 0 1, ( ) 0 (4) Similarly, the short-term zero-crossings rates of the construction sounds without background noise and the environmental noise are calculated and plotted in Fig. 4(b). The values of this feature are below 200 for the three kinds of ambient noise and over 500 for construction sounds. It conrms that the short-term zero-crossing rate can eectively distinguish construction threat sounds from wind noise, which can be used as a supplement to the short-term energy feature. 3.3. Mel frequency cepstral coecients MFCC is a feature in the frequency domain based on the mechanism of human auditory perception [19]. As shown in Fig. 5, the calculation process for MFCC includes the following steps: (1) Pre-emphasis processing is rst required to boost the high-fre- quency performance of acoustic signals. The signals are processed by a pre-emphasis lter that can be expressed as: =   H n a y n ( ) 1 [ ( )] 1 (5) where y(n) is the frame to be ltered and a is a constant generally set to 0.95. (2) The time series data H(n) are then converted to the frequency (a) Excavator breaking hammer (b) Road cutter (c) Electric hammer (d) Traffic noise Fig. 1. Scenarios for collecting sound signals.

(3) The spectral energy of a frame is calculated by: = E k P k ( ) [ ( )]2 (7) (4) The energy spectrum of a frame in the frequency domain is ltered by the Mel lter bank, and the energy in each Mel lter is given by:  =   = G e E k D k e M ( ) ( ) ( ), 1 k e 0 (8) where G(e) is the e-th Mel lter energy, De(k) is the lter function of the e-th bandpass lter and M is the total number of Mel lters generally taken as 12. (5) The logarithms of Mel lter energy in Eq. (8) are calculated and processed by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for MFCC. MFCC can be expressed as:  =      = MFCC e M G e h e M ( ) 2 log[ ( )] cos (2 1) 2 e M 1 (9) where MFCC(e) is the e-th MFCC. 4. Random forest model for classier training The classier generated by machine learning algorithms can iden- tify unknown acoustic signal samples based on the information in the training samples. A randomized training set containing sound samples of various conditions is very helpful to improve the quality of classier. Fig. 3. Acoustic signals in frequency domain.

Li Autom ation in Construction 113 (2020) 103125 4 The training set in this paper consists of randomly selected samples of dierent construction activities, environmental noise and distances between construction threats and microphones. The total number of training samples in the training set is 2400 (one 20 ms frame is used as one sample in this section), and the specic numbers of samples under dierent conditions are shown in Table 2. Acoustic signals not selected as the training samples are used for the classier testing in Section 5, and the numbers of testing samples are presented in Table 3. Using the combination of sound features extracted in Section 3, two classiers are trained based on the random forest algorithm. To dis- tinguish the construction sounds from the three types of environmental noise, the multi-feature vector formed by short-term energy and short- term zero-crossing rate is employed to train Classier-1. To dis- criminate dierent construction threats caused by excavator breaking hammers, road cutters and electric hammers, the other vector consisted of MFCC, short-term energy and short-term zero-crossing rate is used for training Classier-2. The random forest algorithm used for classier training is
