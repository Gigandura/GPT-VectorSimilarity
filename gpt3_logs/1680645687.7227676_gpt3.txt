The detection of construction activities near pipelines based on acoustic signals can eectively reduce pipeline damage. In the framework of collecting datafeature extractionclassier trainingmonitoring scheme, this paper presents a construction sound monitoring system to prevent the underground pipeline damage caused by construction. The construction sounds of electric hammers, road cutters and excavator breaking hammers are collected as well as environmental noise. A double-layer identication scheme consisting of two random forest-based classiers makes up the core of the system. The classier-1 is rst established to detect suspicious sounds. Cutting out the suspected segments as inputs, the classier-2 is then trained to correct the results of the classier-1 and further identify the types of construction activities. In the test, 95.59% of the construction sounds near pipelines are detected, while only 1.12% of environmental noise causes false positives. 1. Introduction Construction activities have seriously jeopardized the safety of un- derground pipelines. According to the statistical data on pipeline ac- cidents in China, the United States [1] and Europe [2], those caused by civil construction account for 68%, 29.8% and 28% of all pipeline ac- cidents respectively. Such grim statistics call for eective measures to stop construction activities that pose a threat to pipelines. The most common measures in engineering practice to prevent the construction threats is to set up warning boards, caution tapes or one- call systems [3]. These passive measures, however, highly depend on subjective cooperation between construction workers and pipeline companies. To enhance the ability of active supervision, more techni- ques have been recently developed for real-time monitoring of con- struction activities near pipelines. According to the types of the col- lected signals, the common monitoring methods can be divided into vibration monitoring, video/image monitoring, electrical signal mon- itoring and acoustic signal monitoring. Vibration signals generated by construction can be collected by optical ber [47], static sensing cable or multi-seismic sensors [8], which perform well in identifying and locating construction threats. However, the installation of the vibration monitoring system costs too much for the existing pipeline, as the sensors must be placed underground. The video/image monitoring system is generally used in perimeter warning of city gate stations with the xed cameras. It can also be applied to monitor construction activities by using image re- cognition technology to process aero-photograph [9], but the aircraft inspection is limited by weather condition and usually costs a lot. An- other method is to monitor excavation damage with the aid of the cathodic protection system [10]. However, the construction threats cannot cause signicant changes in the electrical signals. Using the acoustic signals recorded by microphones, Wan et al. propose a support vector machine (SVM) based method to identify the sound signals of the road cutter [11]. Compared with the three kinds of monitoring systems as mentioned earlier, the sound monitoring system has the advantages of simple arrangement, good applicability and accurate recognition, which shows
